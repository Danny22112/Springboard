    "The telecom industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly vying for customer loyalty. A key metric that helps evaluate the health of a telecom business is the churn rateâ€”the percentage of customers who leave a service over a given period. Understanding churn is critical for telecom companies, as high churn rates often indicate dissatisfaction, unmet customer needs, or better offers from competitors. In this dataset, wecan identify the factors driving churn and devise strategies to improve customer retention, reduce acquisition costs, and boost overall profitability."

But as time goes on, you notice a troubling trend: an increasing number of customers are canceling their subscriptions. You were confident they loved your product, so why are they leaving in such numbers? This leaves you puzzled and searching for answers: What went wrong?\n",
